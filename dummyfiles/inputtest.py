firstname = input("Enter your firstname :")
lastname = input("Enter your lastname :")
age = input("Enter your age :")

print("Your full name is ",firstname,lastname,age)

# Check data type of output, intresting that a int output is considered a string. but makes sense i guess since its text output
print (type(firstname))
print (type(age))
